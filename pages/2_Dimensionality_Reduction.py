- T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) is a fancy way to say we don't think you (or we) could read a 17-dimensional plot. Instead, we took all 17 activities the ATUS records and reduced them to 2-dimensions, which you see here. Months that have similar distributions of activity times are closer together. We connected months by their order in time. 
- Take note of the colors here - you‚Äôll see them again. We grouped our data into three sections: pre-COVID peak (January 2019 to February 2020), COVID peak (March 2020 to January 2021), and post-COVID peak (February 2021 to December 2021).
- If you read nothing else on this page: Notice the orange points (months before the COVID peak hit us like a bus) have no overlap with the blue points (the peak COVID months). This means the time we spent on the 17 activity categories weren‚Äôt very similar before COVID and during the COVID peak. We see the purple months (the months after we got COVID hospitalizations under control) overlap with both the orange and blue points. So, post-COVID months are somewhere in between pre-COVID months and peak COVID months in terms of similarity of time spent in the 17 activity categories.
- Hover over points in the plot on the left to see the average number of minutes spent in the 10 categories we found to have significantly different averages in 2019 and 2020 (using a two-sample t-test with non-equal variances at the ùõÇ = 0.05 significance level). The bars will move with each activity. The activity with the highest amount of time spent will always shift to the top.
